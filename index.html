      <h2>About Me </h2>
      <p> I started out in audio ML, spending my academic years as a student researcher, interning at places like Adobe. My first full-time industry job was at Dolby Labs, where I focused on deep learning and audio codecs. That kicked off nearly a decade of building AI systems for audio understanding. At CurieAI, I was the first hire. I worked side-by-side with the founders to develop audio understanding models that could detect and classify respiratory symptoms in real-world, noisy environments. We scaled our solution to hundreds of patients, a huge technical and logistical challenge. From there, I made a deliberate pivot into NLP. AI was moving fast in that space, and I wanted to push myself into something unfamiliar. At UnitedHealth Group, I built an MVP for a consumer-facing search tool that let users ask natural language questions about their health benefits. I trained language models, some from scratch, others fine-tuned which became the foundation for a full-blown enterprise search platform. Again, I was the first on the team. I scaled that org from one person to 50+, all while continuing to build custom semantic search and embedding models. That experience completely reshaped how I thought about deep learning. And once I felt confident in NLP, I wanted to apply my signal processing background to a new challenge: brain-computer interfaces. I joined Precision as a Staff Machine Learning Scientist, with almost zero neuroscience experience. On the job, I picked up the skills to process non-stationary, high-density ECoG data translating raw brain signals into real-time actions. I worked closely with clinical, neuroscience, product, regulatory, and QA teams, and I built models that had to generalize across patients, sessions, and tasks. </p>
